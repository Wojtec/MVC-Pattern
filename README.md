# MVC-Pattern

Requirements

<b>Phase I </b>
- Research
- What is an architecture pattern?
- What is the MVC pattern?
- Draw a scheme that clearly depicts what the MVC pattern is.
- Describe use cases of this pattern
- Describe the steps of a request from its creation to its response using this pattern.
- Advantages of MVC.

<b>Phase II</b> 
- Development
- Implement the MVC pattern using PHP without any library
- Use a clear directory structure. You must have a minimum of:
- 2 controllers
- 2 data models that obtain information from a database (you can use MySQL or a local file)
- 2 views
- 2 URL’s that demonstrate that the pattern is implemented correctly and are capable of displaying the data obtained from the       source in a view. URL’s can be controlled by:
-> URL parameters
-> mod_rewrite (you have to take into account that this option requires the use of the “.htaccess” file

<b>Important</b>
- Design is not valued
- Topic is not taken into account
- Order and organisation of files and directories is valued
- OOP is required
- It is recommended to see examples of PHP MVC
- Focus on the implementation of the pattern and not so much on how to obtain or paint the data
- If you use MySQL (or another database engine) do not spend too much time designing the database, for now it is NOT important, the main point is focused on the understanding of the pattern and the path of a request from when it is created until it is fullfiled.

<b>Pill management</b>
- Document requirements
- List tasks:
       -> Priority
       -> Title and description
       -> Difficulty
       -> Estimated time
- Incidents record
- Calendar the project 
- Document risks -Document the GIT WORKFLOW used
- Documentation about the tools used in the project 
- Record of lessons learnt.

<b>Delivery</b>
- This repo
- PDF document including the theoretical documentation.

<b>Resources</b>
- README Guidelines Example
